## Fractal Sets

Julia & Mandelbrot Sets are defined by: 

> $Z_{n+1} = Z_{n} + c$

Z = a Complex number at n-th iteration;
c = Constant complex number corresponding to a point in the complex plane.
### The Mandelbrot Set
Was discovered by Benoit B. Mandelbrot while investigating mappings of the function:
> $f(z) = z^2 + c$

Is generated by iterating a simple function on the points of the complex plane. 
- Points that `produce a cycle` (the same value over and over again) fall in the set;
- Points that `diverge` (give ever-growing values) lie outside it [Different colors represent different rates of diversion].
#### Generating the Mandelbrot Set

#- Start from point $Z_0$ of the complex plane;
- Use the quadratic recurrence equation $Z_{n+1} = Z_{n}^2 + Z_{0}$ to obtain a sequence of complex numbers $Z_{n}$;

> - The points $Z_{n}$ are said to form the orbit of $Z_{0}$;
> - The Mandelbrot set, denoted by `M` is defined:
> 
> If the orbit $Z_n$ fails to go to infinity, 
> 
> > we say that $Z_{n}$ is contained within the set $M$.
> > real numbers that are contained within the set hafractalfoundation.org/fractivities/FractalPacks-EducatorsGuide.pdfve to be in between $-2$ and $1/4$
> > imaginary numbers on the other hand have to be in between $-0.6i$ and $0.6i$
> 
> If the orbit $Z_n$ does go to infinity, 
> 
> > we say that the point $Z_{0}$ is outside $M$.## The Julia Set
