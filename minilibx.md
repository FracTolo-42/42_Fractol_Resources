**minilibX** is a simple X-Window API written in C, designed to introduce students to the **X-Window System**. [^1]

## X-Window System

The **X-Window System** is an architecture independent windowing system for bitmap displays that provides a basic framework for creating graphical user interfaces. [^2]

It enables users to draw and move windows on a display using the mouse and keyboard.
